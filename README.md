# Stickier

A rudimentary app written in Swift to mimic the functionality of Matt Gemmell's excellent [Sticky Notifications app](http://instinctivecode.com/sticky-notifications/).
This was written as an attempt to better learn Swift and Cocoa, so it's pretty rough around the edges and probably buggy.
It's still not fully featured, and I dunno if it'll ever be.

## Thanks
Thanks to [WeAreYeah](https://github.com/weAreYeah) for [WAYTheDarkSide](https://github.com/weAreYeah/WAYTheDarkSide), a nice library to help OSX apps stay the same theme as OSX.

## Licensing
Licensed under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net). So do whatever you want with my code, I guess.
